# InterSpec
InterSpec is a web-based application to assist in analyzing spectral nuclear radiation data, using a peak-based methodology.
Common uses include identifying nuclides present, determining source activity, shielding amounts, source age, or other nuclear reactions present.
InterSpec also provides a number of other tools useful for analyzing radiation data including spectral file format converting,
dose rate calculations, interactive nuclide decay and reference information, gamma cross section calculations, and more.
InterSpec can open data files from most common spectral radiation detectors (e.g., most NaI, HPGe, LaBr, 
CLYC, CsI, etc. based systems) and assist in their analysis.
InterSpec can also be built as a stand-alone (e.g., not Internet connection necessary) native app (using either OS provided WebView, or [Electron](https://github.com/electron/electron) for display) for Windows, Linux, macOS, iOS, or Android.


## Getting Started

If you just care about using a pre-compiled executable, head over to 
[releases](https://github.com/sandialabs/interspec/releases) and download the latest.
A getting started guide will be released soon.

If you would like to build the app, some instructions are bellow.

If you are developer of radiation analysis software, there is, in particular some code that 
may be useful for you:
1. [sandia_decay](https://github.com/sandialabs/interspec/tree/master/external_libs/sandia_decay): This small library reads in [sandia.decay.xray.xml](https://github.com/sandialabs/interspec/tree/master/data/sandia.decay.xray.xml) and allows you to retrieve the half-lives, xrays, gammas, alpha, betas, etc given off by any certain nuclide, or you can easily decay nuclides and find activities of the decay chain nuclides, the particles that will be given off at any time, and more.  An emphasis is placed on easy to use, but computationally efficient code.
2. [SpecUtils](https://github.com/sandialabs/interspec/tree/master/external_libs/SpecUtils): If you have to read in spectral files, including [N42](https://www.nist.gov/programs-projects/ansiieee-n4242-standard), [PCF](http://prod.sandia.gov/techlib/access-control.cgi/2017/179107.pdf), SPC, DAT, CHN, etc., this library may do what you want.  It decodes many file format variants, and saves to about a dozen different formats.  This library can be called from c++, Python, or Java, or if you want a very simple gui to do this, or a command line application, check out [cambio](https://hekili.ca.sandia.gov/cambio/) (which is powered by this library)


### Prerequisites

To compile, you need a c++11 compiler, and:
* [Wt](https://www.webtoolkit.eu/wt) versions 3.3.1 through 3.3.4 should work, but 3.3.4 is recommended.
* [boost](https://www.boost.org/) versions 1.48 through 1.65.1 will probably work, but development is done using 1.65.1.
* [cmake](https://cmake.org/) 

To make building a little easier, other required libraries, including 
[Cuba](http://www.feynarts.de/cuba), 
[Minuit2](https://github.com/root-project/root/tree/master/math/minuit2), 
[muparserx](https://github.com/beltoforion/muparserx), 
[rapidxml](http://rapidxml.sourceforge.net/), 
and [websocketpp](https://github.com/zaphoyd/websocketpp), are included in this git repository already in the  
[external_libs](https://github.com/sandialabs/interspec/tree/master/external_libs) directory, while 
the [js](https://github.com/sandialabs/interspec/tree/master/js) directory contains some ECMAScript libraries, including
[jQuery](https://jquery.org),
[qTip2](http://qtip2.com),
[SILK ICONS](http://www.famfamfam.com/lab/icons/silk), and
[D3](https://d3js.org).


### Installing

After installing boost, Wt, and cmake using either your package manager, or building from source, clone the 
InterSpec repository, and from the terminal, run cmake:

```
git clone https://github.com/sandialabs/interspec/
cd interspec
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
```

If you are on Windows, or prefer a GUI, running the CMake for building InterSpec should be like
most other CMake project; you will probably have to fill in paths to boost and Wt manually.


And then make:
```
make -j8
```

If all goes well, InterSpec default to building an executable that when ran from the command line, starts a local web server, you can access then access from your browser.  To run InterSpec, use a command like:
```
./bin/InterSpec.exe --docroot . --http-address 0.0.0.0 --http-port 8080 -c ./data/wt_config.xml
```
and then point your browser to [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080).


If you would like build as a native-ish app, see the *BUILD_AS_OSX_APP*, or *BUILD_AS_ELECTRON_APP* CMake options. 
For building as a WebApp behind something like nginx or apache, see *BUILD_FOR_WEB_DEPLOYMENT*.
There are also a number of CMake options available to set to control which features get included in InterSpec.


Building for iOS and Android are both possible (see the [target](https://github.com/sandialabs/interspec/tree/master/target) directory), and these instructions will be updated in the future.
