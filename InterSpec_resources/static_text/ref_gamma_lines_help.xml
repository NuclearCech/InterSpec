<b>Trouble Fitting Peaks for Shielding</b>
</h1>

</div>
<div>
Access and launch the <b>Reference Photopeaks</b> tool by
<u>selecting</u>
<b>Tools &#8594; Reference Photopeaks</b> menu (tool tabs hidden) or 3rd tab.</div>
<div style="padding-top: 10px">Inputting the &#34;Nuclide&#34; and &#34;Age&#34; will immediately alter the calibration of the spectrum.</div>
<div style="padding-top: 10px">
If the calibration is still not accurate, you can manually account for potential shielding by
<u>selecting</u>
the shielding material from the list of options, and
<u>inputting</u>
the appropriate thickness. Often this will alter your spectrum such that peaks will fit the isotope they reflect more accurately.
</div>
<div>
<ul>
<u>Input</u>
the units in which the thickness of the material was measured after inputting the quantity.
Separate the units from the number with a single space; trouble fitting will not occur otherwise.
</ul>
