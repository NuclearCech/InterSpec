ToDo:
 - When taking background off, get 'spectra' is null
 - When app dies in JS, check if its possible to detect and thus get rid of all the menu stuff, to prevent duplicate menues...
   - Or maybe there is way to detect in node when a page is about to load, then can call the menu setup stuff
 - Time startup time compared to before
 - Combine spectra...
 - phd format
 -
