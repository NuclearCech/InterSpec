         One way to recalibrate is by
         <u>navigating</u>
         to the
         <b>Peak Manager</b>
         tab on the bottom tools tabs of the window,
         <u>selecting</u>
         <b>ID Nuclides</b>
         so that the application can identify 
what it deems to be appropriate nuclides for your given spectrum,
         <u>navigating</u>
         to the
         <b>Energy Calibration</b>
         tab also on the bottom tools tabs, and then
         <u>checking/unchecking</u>
         under 
&#34;Calib. Peak&#34; the nuclides the application identified that you are in agreement with; checked boxes classify the identity of the nuclide as &#34;true,&#34; unchecked 
boxes classify the identity as &#34;false.&#34;

            You can still manually change the calibration parameters by adjusting the &#34;Offset Term,&#34; &#34;Linear Term,&#34; and &#34;Quad. Term&#34; located on the left 
half of the tools tab under the
            <b>Calibration</b>
            tab.
