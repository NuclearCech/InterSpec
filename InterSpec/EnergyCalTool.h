/** This class handles energy calibration by the user.
 
 Energy calibration can be a suprising complicated or nuanced operation, but the user almost never
 cares about the details, and they just want to make a peak lineup with a reference line.  So the
 goal of this class is facilitate the most complex energy calibrations, while defaulting to letting
 the user not worry about the details.
 
 There can be a wide variation of energy calibration scenerious in spectrum files:
 - Single record with defined energy calibration
 - Multiple samples, all from the same detector, all with the same energy calibration
 - Multiple samples, all from the same detector, but calibration changes between samples
 - Multiple samples, each with different detectors, but all detectors and samples use same energy
   calbration
 - Multiple samples, each with different detectors, but each detector uses a different energy
   calibration, but that remains same for all samples.
 - Multiple samples, each with different detectors, and some or all detectors calibration may change
   throughout with sample.
 - Some sample/detectors may be lower channel, while others polynomial or FRF
 - Different deviation pairs for each detector, but constant throughout the file
 - Different deviation pairs for each detector, but may change throughout the file
 
 And the user may want to apply calibration differences in a few ways:
 - Apply change in energy calibration to every detector and every sample in file
 - Apply change to only certain detectors, but for every sample in file
 - Apply change to only the sample numbers currently contributing to spectrum, but all detectors
 - Apply change to only the sample numbers and detectors currently contributing to spectrum
 - Apply change to all detectors, but only visible samples
 Where calibration differences means propogating the change in linear term for detector Aa1, to
 Aa2, and not just simply setting Aa1 and Aa2's linear coefficients equal to each other.
 
 Users may want to:
 - re-bin all spectrum to the same energy calibration before/after doing recalibration
 - linearize spectra
 - change from polynomial to FRF, etc
 - Edit deviation pairs
 - Convert lower channel energies to polynomial/FRF coefficients, or other way
 - Revert energy calibration to original calbiration given in file
 - Revert to a previous energy calibration
 
 The ways users may want to perform a calbiration include:
 - Fit one or more peaks that have an assigned nuclide, and use that to fit coefficients
 - Drag spectrum using mouse to where it should be; they may do this for, offset, gain, or deviation
   pairs
 - Use multiple files to fit coefficients (useful for lower resolution detectors that measured one
   nuclide at a time).
