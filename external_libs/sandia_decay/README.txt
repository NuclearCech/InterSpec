SandiaDecay: library that provides nuclear decay informations and calculations.

Requires rapidxml (http://rapidxml.sourceforge.net/) and a c++ compiler to compile.

Parsing code is maintained by Will Johnson (wcjohns@sandia.gov) while
Steven Horne (smhorne@sandia.gov) and Gregory Thoreson (ggthore@sandia.gov) 
maintain sandia.decay.xml.

Source data in sandia.decay.xml is originally based on ENSDF data, with 
corrections based on observed gamma spectroscopy data.  X-ray information
obtained from the ToRI x-ray database.
