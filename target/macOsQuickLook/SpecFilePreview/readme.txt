This QuickLook plugin allows displaying previews of spectrum files in the Finder, 
or other applications that take advantage of this feature, by generating 
thumbnails from the file contents. 

To install, after extracting SpecFilePreview.qlgenerator from the downloaded zip 
file, copy the bundle /Library/QuickLook/ (will likely need sudo permissions; if 
you dont have these you can try copying to 
/Users/<your username>/Library/QuickLook/)
