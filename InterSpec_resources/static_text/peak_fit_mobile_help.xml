  <h1 id="zoom-in"><b>Peak Fitting</b></h1>
  <hr />
</div>

<p><em>Suggestion:</em> <i>Before fitting for peaks, display the reference lines responsible for the peaks if known -
this way the peak will be associated with the appropriate nuclide at the time of fitting, rather than having to be 
manually associated later to perform activity fitting or do energy calibration.</i>
</p>

<p>
The simplest way to fit a nuclide is to double tap on the area the peak is located:
<div style="padding-top: 10px" align="center">
  <img src="InterSpec_resources/static_text/images/touch_fit_peak.png"  class="imageBorder" style="width:75%;" />
</div>
</p>
<p>If there are multiple peaks in an area, you can double tap on each peak peak, to fit additional peaks.
<div style="padding-top: 10px" align="center">
  <img src="InterSpec_resources/static_text/images/touch_multipeak_fit.png"  class="imageBorder" style="width:75%;" />
</div>
