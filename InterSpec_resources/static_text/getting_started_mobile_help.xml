<p>You can open spectra from your email, file, other applications, by tapping on the file and selecting the &quot;Copy To InterSpec&quot; option.

<p>
You can also open files from within InterSpec by going to the menu then <em>Spectra</em> &rarr; <em>Open File...</em> and then selecting to browse.

<p>
If you are opening a foreground and background from the same detector, using another application,
and you would like to display both at the same time, you should open the foreground spectrum first,
and then when you open the background spectrum from the other app, <em>InterSpec</em> will
detect the file is from the same detector, and ask you if you want to open it as a foreground,
background, or secondary foreground spectrum.

<p>
InterSpec can open nearly all common gamma spectra formats, including N42, SPE, PCF, SPC, CSV, and other detector specific formats.
